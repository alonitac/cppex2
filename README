Theoretical Questions:

1. WhatsApp - you want to download a video while chatting with the person who sent the video.
    it's reasonable to be able to chat while downloading a video,
    but doing it using two different processes it's a bad idea because the processes are sharing
    a lot of information.

2. The main advantage is security, especially when browsing sensitive information.
    The disadvantage is performance of course. typical user expect to be able to open
    multiple tabs without feeling that the browser is getting slower.

4. Real-time as the name hints - the elapsed processing time in reality. Usage example -
   trigger some signal in the program, when the real time elapsed is important, e.g. in Iron Dome program

   Virtual time counts the processor time used by the process. Usage example -
   profiling performance of program.
